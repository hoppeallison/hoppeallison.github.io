title: Week 1 MTA Analysis
---

Week 1 included a project for a fictional client who was interested in using data analytics to maximize outreach for their WomenTechWomenYes gala. The goal was to optimize the placement of their street teams to reach the greatest amount of people that would be interested in increasing the participation of women in technology. 

To optimize the placement of their street teams we used publicly available Metropolitan Transportation Authority turnstile data for the analysis. For this project we talked about having a MVP or minimum viable product. We decided that our MVP would include 1) finding the top five busiest station, 2) finding the busiest days of the week, and 3) finding the busiest time of the day. We decided to use the number of entries through the turnstiles to identify the busiest stations. Number of exits was also included in the data but we felt that exit counts may not be as regulated as entry counts.

After cleaning the data (removing duplicates and outliers) we used matplotlib to show the top station results by day of week and time of day.
